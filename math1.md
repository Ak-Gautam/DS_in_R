Sure, let's break down each step:

1. The given equation is:
   $$\frac{{\sin\theta - \cos\theta}}{{\sin\theta + \cos\theta}} + \frac{{\sin\theta + \cos\theta}}{{\sin\theta - \cos\theta}} = \frac{2}{{2\sin^2\theta-1}}$$
   This is the equation you provided.

2. We multiply the two fractions on the left-hand side (LHS) by their denominators to simplify the equation. This is a common technique in algebra to eliminate the denominator.

3. After multiplying, we get:
   $$LHS = (\sin^2\theta - 2\sin\theta \cos\theta + \cos^2\theta) + (\sin^2\theta + 2\sin\theta \cos\theta + \cos^2\theta)$$
   This is just expanding the brackets using the formula (a-b)^2 and (a+b)^2.

4. Further simplifying gives:
   $$LHS = 2(\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta)$$
   Here, we combine like terms.

5. We know that $\sin^2x + \cos^2x = 1$, this is a fundamental identity in trigonometry often called the Pythagorean trigonometric identity. So we substitute this into our equation to get:
   $$LHS = 2(1) = 2$$

6. Now let's simplify the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation:
   $$RHS = \frac{2}{{2(\sin^2x)-1}}$$
   This is the RHS of your provided equation.

7. We know that $2(\sin^2x)$ can be written as $1 - (\cos^2x)$, this comes from rearranging the Pythagorean trigonometric identity, so substituting this in gives:
   $$RHS = \frac{2}{{1 - (\cos^2x)}}$$

8. We also know that $\frac{1}{{1 - (\cos^2x)}}$ is equal to $\sec^2x$, this is another trigonometric identity, so substituting this in gives:
   $$RHS = 2(\sec^2x)$$

9. Since $\sec x$ is equal to $\frac{1}{\cos x}$, we can substitute this in to get:
   $$RHS = 2(\frac{1}{(\cos x)^2})$$
   Here we are using the definition of secant in terms of cosine.

10. Finally, since $\frac{1}{(\cos x)^2}$ is equal to $1$, we get:
    $$RHS = 2(1) = 2$$
    Here we are assuming that cos(x) is not equal to zero because division by zero is undefined.

So, we have $LHS = RHS$, which verifies that the given equation is correct.
